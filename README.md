# Polar Data Analysis

This is a tool for analysing data collected through Polar activities.

## Getting Started

Add your environment variables to a project .env file. Generate a NextAuth.js secret by running the command:
`openssl rand -base64 32`

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
